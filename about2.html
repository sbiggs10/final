		<p>Howdy y'all! My name is Sadie Biggs. I am a 19 year old freshman in college an I am persuing a degree in Digital Media. I was born in San Antionio, into a military family. Throughout my childhood I lived in several different places including Italy, Maryland, Illinios, and Texas. When I lived in Illinios I discovered my love of gardening, while visiting a friends house. Ever since that exprience I have loved to garden. I created this website to help those who are considering raising their own plants to suceed in their efforts. I wanted to create a cummunity of likeminded gardeners, who live in souther Texas, so that we may encourage and give advice to one another. Happy Gardening! (:  </p>
